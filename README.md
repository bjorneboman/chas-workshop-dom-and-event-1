## Chas Workshop 
# DOM & Event

Chas Academy workshop about DOM manipulation and event handling. We mobbed this workshop in groups of three, with one driver and two navigators, switching roles occationally.

The workshop was divided into two sessions each with its own set of excercises. During session one we finished the first three exercises, partially completed the fourth, leaving the fifth exercise untouched. 

In the second session we only completed the first exercise, partially finished the second leaving the rest unfinished. 

## Instructions
